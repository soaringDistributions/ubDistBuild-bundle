There is sufficient evidence that vc_redist.x64.exe is in fact redistributable. However, the documentation of this seems unnecessarily convoluted, and possibly (especially for acceptably new/safe versions), dependent on a potentially changing set of web pages (rather than up front in less interpretable terms in the installer license text).

Consequently, for any software which depends on 'vc_redist' and which does not itself redistribute these files, that software itself (eg. 'Oracle' VirtualBox) will be regarded as pushing dubious legal contradictions, and avoided at the earliest opportunity.


# MSW Binary for VirtualBox apparently depends on 'vc_redist', which may not be or may not remain a usable dependency. Thus, although Linux VirtualBox may be usefully available, only the source code may exist for MSW.
# Any use or availability of VirtualBox, not just MSW, is now strongly discouraged, and likely will be eliminated eventually in favor of QEMU .

#  Seems there is some controversy here. In fact, there is license text to allow redistribution of 'vc_redist.x64.exe' . Microsoft's own knowledgeable 'Bing Chat' confirms Microsoft does allow sharing the file so long as some guidelines are followed.

#  The obvious conclusion is that MSW documentation regarding redistributable licensing either is not well documented or more likely relies on legalease which Oracle dislikes. In any case, transitioning away from and preserving open-source code from, VirtualBox, is a reasonable response at this time.


'Redistributing Visual C++ Files article on the Microsoft Learn website. This article contains the “REDIST list” that specifies the files that you are allowed to copy and distribute as part of your program’s installation package, subject to the license terms. One of the files listed is vc_redist.x64.exe, which means you can redistribute it as long as you follow the guidelines in the article.' -Bing Chat, 2023-12-25
